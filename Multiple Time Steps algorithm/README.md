# Code overview

This code implements the Multiple Time Steps algorithm to simulate a system of interacting particles with different masses. 


**To run the code** 
- modifying the sim.hpp file choose the type of interaction (standard is Lennard-Jones)
- the algotype parameters let you choose to use the standard integration algorithm or the MTS (0 = standard, 1 = MTS)
