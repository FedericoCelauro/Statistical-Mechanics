# Statistical-Mechanics

This repository is a collection of codes to do simulations of systems made of many interacting particles. To do so, both Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics methods are implemented.

## Content 
- **MC and MD base code** contains the base code to do normal Monte Carlo simulations (in NTV and NPT ensemles) and Molecular Dynamics based on symplectic second order algorithms.
- **Multiple Time Steps algorithm** contains the implementation of the multiple time steps method (Tuckerman) in MD simulations

## Future Projects
- Write base code for gran canonical ensemble
- Implement successive (or even parallel) umbrella sampling
- Implement other r-respa (such as long and short range forces and exact integration)
- Implement simple biatomic particle simulation
- Brownian dynamics
- Nos√®-Hoover dynamics
- Aggregation volume bias MC
